# Ali Shehper

I am an AI Researcher at Essential AI, working on the science of language model pre-training.

Previously, I was a Research Scientist at Caltech where I worked on Reinforcement Learning for Math. Before that, I was a Physicist, working on supersymmetric and topological quantum field theories.
