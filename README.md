I am a postdoc in Physics at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/). I like to train machine learning models and study their internal behavior.

Prior to this, I studied theoretical physics during my Ph.D, working on quantum field theories. A list of my research papers can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FkUMJF4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). 

I am interested in the study of Large Language Models. Recently, I implemented their scaling laws using [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT); please check out this project [here](https://github.com/shehper/scaling_laws).

I am also interested in Reinforcement Learning and through its applications to problems in Mathematics (my current area of research) and RLHF. 

I believe the future of deep learning involves tuning much less hyperparameters. Instead, we will be using various theoretical insights to get the best performance out of our models. Some of my most favorite recent papers include works on [muP](https://github.com/microsoft/mup), [batch size-invariance for policy gradient algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00641), and [scaling laws for single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13442). 

If you are also interested in similar things (or just want to chat), please feel free to reach out.
