I currently hold a postdoctoral position at the [New High Energy Theory Center](https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/het/) at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/). In this role, I am focused on applying Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning techniques to address open problems in pure mathematics.

Prior to this, I earned my PhD in Physics from The University of Texas at Austin, where my research spanned the subjects of both Physics and Mathematics. I [leveraged insights from Quantum Field Theory to yield novel mathematical results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08032) and employed [analytical](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01970) and [computational](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15249) methods to uncover new findings in Quantum Field Theories.

For simple descriptions of my PhD papers, please refer to this link. Alternatively, you may watch a video talk of me summarizing my PhD work here.

I grew up in [Lahore, Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore) where I completed my BS in Physics from [Lahore University of Management Sciences](https://lums.edu.pk/). As an undergraduate, I studied [supersymmetric and topological field theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02662) under the supervision of [Amer Iqbal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amer_Iqbal).
