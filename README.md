# Ali Shehper

I am a Research Scientist at Caltech, building AI systems to solve hard, research-level math problems.

Previously, I received my PhD in Physics from UT Austin, under the guidance of [Jacques Distler](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/) and [Andrew Neitkze](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~an592/).

## AI Papers:

- [What makes math problems hard for reinforcement learning: a case study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15332),

## Code:

- **[AC-Solver](https://github.com/shehper/AC-Solver):**  
  A Python library for tackling long-horizon, ultra-sparse-reward RL environments, designed to accompany [our case study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15332).
  
- **[Sparse-Dictionary-Learning](https://github.com/shehper/sparse-dictionary-learning):**  
  An open-source implementation of Anthropicâ€™s [Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models with Dictionary Learning](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html).
  
- **[Neural Scaling Laws](https://github.com/shehper/scaling_laws):**  
  An implementation of [Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361), along with results from [An Empirical Model of Large-Batch Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06162).

- **[Language Model Feature Browser](https://shehper.github.io/feature-interface/):**  
  A visualizer for features learned by a 1-layer Language Model, with the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shehper/feature-interface).
