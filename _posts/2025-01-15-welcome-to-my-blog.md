Welcome to my blog! This is a sample post to show you how blog posts work.

You can write your posts in Markdown, just like you would in Notion. Here's how:

## Headers work like this

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, and even [links](https://example.com).

### Lists work too:

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

You can also include code blocks:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Blog!")
```

To create a new blog post, just create a new file in the `_posts` directory with the format:
`YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-title.md`

Make sure to include the front matter at the top (the part between the `---` lines) with at least the `layout`, `title`, and `date` fields.

Happy blogging!
